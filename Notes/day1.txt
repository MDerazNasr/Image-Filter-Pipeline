Day 1 Goals:
- setup pipeline
- load an image with opencv
- run own grayscale code w/out opencv
- save the output
- print the timing

What does CV_8UC3 mean?

It’s OpenCV’s way to describe pixel format:
8U = 8-bit unsigned numbers (0–255)
C3 = 3 channels (Blue, Green, Red)
So a color pixel is 3 bytes:
    B, G, R (OpenCV uses BGR order)

3) What is grayscale?

Grayscale has 1 channel (CV_8UC1).
One number per pixel (0–255).

To convert BGR → Gray:

use a weighted average (brightness perception)

common formula:
gray = 0.114*B + 0.587*G + 0.299*R

4) What is “timing” in C++?

We use <chrono> to measure how long code takes.

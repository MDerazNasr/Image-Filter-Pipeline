Day 5 - multithreading

goal
- split the image into horizontal row chunks and have multiple CPU cores process different 
chunks in parrallel

--threads 8 should reduce per-frame time noticeably
- no crashes no corrupted output
- you understand what each thread is doing and why its safe

mental model - why multithreading works

your image is made of rows:
- row 0
- row 1
- row 2
- ....
if each thread handles different rows, then:

if each thread handles diffrent rows, then:
- Thread A writes rows 0-40
- Thread B writes rows 41-80 
- Thread C writes rows 81-120
- .... 

They do not write to the same memory, so they won't fight

Key rule to avoid bugs=
- multiple threads can read the same input image safely
- multiple threads can write to the same output image only if they write different rows

Goal for Day 3
 - take a grayscale/blurred image
 - compute the edges using Sobel (a fundamental discrete differentiation operator used in image processing and computer vision for edge detection.)
 - output an edge image
 - understand

you will run:
./build/pipeline --image data/input.jpg --out output/out_edges.png

What is an edge?
- an edge is where pixel values change suddenly

example (1d)
10 10 10 10 200 200 200
              ↑
            edge

Edges matter because:
- objects are defined by boundaries
- vision systems detect structure, not colour
- Almost evert vision pipeline starts with gradients

What Sobel actually does
- Sobel measures how fast brightness changes in:
    - x direction (left <-> right)
    - Y direction (top <-> bottom)
it does this usuing two tiny 3x3 kernels

Sobel kernels (memorise these)
- horizontal change (Gx)
- Detects vertical edges\
-1  0  +1
-2  0  +2
-1  0  +1

vertical change (Gy)
Detects horizontal edges
-1  -2  -1
 0   0   0
+1  +2  +1

what happens per pixel?
- for each (x, y)
1. apply Gx kernel -> get sx
2. apply Gy kernel -> get sy
3. combine them -> edge strength

True magnitude:
- sqrt(sx^2 + sy^2)
- |sx| + |sy|
this is:
- faster
- good enough
- very common in practice

Borders again (same solution):
yy = clamp(y + dy, 0, height - 1)
xx = clamp(x + dx, 0, width  - 1)
- nothing new here - you already know this
